/*

Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from start to end, such that:

You must change exactly one character in every transformation
Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary.

Key point: all words in the dict will be the same length, as will all the two words given as start and end


Example:

start = "hit"
end = "cog"
dict = {"hot","dot","dog","lot","log"}

The shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
with a path length of 5

//This is the main function

var wordLadder = function(start, end, dict) {
  //implement me!

  //what helper data structures will you need?

  //what helper functions will you need?

};
