/*

Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from start to end, such that:

You must change exactly one character in every transformation
Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary.

Key point: all words in the dict will be the same length, as will all the two words given as start and end

Given:

start = "hit"
end = "cog"
dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
